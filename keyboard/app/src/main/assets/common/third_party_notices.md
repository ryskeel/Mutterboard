## Unicode CLDR Emoji Annotations

- Project: Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)
- Source repository: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json
- Source path used by generator: `cldr-json/cldr-annotations-full/annotations`
- License: Unicode Data Files and Software License / Unicode License

Pastiera's local emoji search assets under `assets/common/emoji_search/*.tsv`
are generated from Unicode CLDR annotation data by `scripts/generate_emoji_search_assets.py`.
The generated TSV files are filtered to the emoji set bundled with Pastiera and normalized
for compact local lookup.

## Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig

- Project: Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig
- Project pages: https://corpora.uni-leipzig.de/ and https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/
- Companion asset repository: https://github.com/palsoftware/pastiera-dict
- License: Creative Commons attribution terms for the downloaded corpus/frequency-list data;
  the Leipzig frequency dictionary word lists are documented as CC-BY 3.0, while current
  downloadable corpus data may carry corpus-specific terms.

Pastiera's bundled base dictionaries under `assets/common/dictionaries/*_base.json`
and the generated serialized dictionaries under `assets/common/dictionaries_serialized/*_base.dict`
are frequency-list derivatives built mainly from Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig
word-frequency data, with project-maintained filtering, truncation, normalization, and additional
entries. The companion `pastiera-dict` repository distributes larger downloadable `.dict` assets
and their manifests.

Provenance note: the maintained dictionary pipeline and current maintainer-provided sources point
mainly to Leipzig/Wortschatz frequency data. Some older bundled entries predate the current
documentation trail, so their exact upstream corpus IDs are not fully reconstructed here.

## eellak GSOC 2019 Greek Morphological Dictionary

- Project: GSOC 2019 - Development of a Greek open source Morphological dictionary and application of it to Greek spelling tools
- Source repository: https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2019-greek-morpho
- Source data used for `el_base.dict`: `data/spell_dict_with_freq.dic`
- License: GPLv3 for source code; CC BY-SA 3.0 for the produced morphological database

The downloadable Greek base dictionary distributed through the companion `pastiera-dict`
repository is derived from the top frequency-ranked, letter-only entries in the eellak
Greek spelling dictionary with Pastiera-specific filtering, truncation, and normalization.
